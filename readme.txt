Create product detail pages for WooCommerce products in Elementor.

<b>Attention:</b>
It will disable the normal product detail links. The idea is that you create simple custom detail pages with your products.

== Installation ==
* install [Elementor](https://be.elementor.com/visit/?bta=207645&brand=elementor)
* install WooCommerce
* install the plugin

== Screenshots ==

1. Backend
2. Product settings - Add a custom attribute "url" to your product and set the link to the detail page you've created. This will be used in the "WC Product list" widget.

== How to use it ==

=== Detail pages ===
* create a normal Elementor page and add the elements (WC Product Title, WC Product Buy Button,...)

=== Product list ===
* add a custom product attribute "url" with the detail page you've created e.g. `/my-product`. This will be used in the list. Check the 2nd screenshot.
